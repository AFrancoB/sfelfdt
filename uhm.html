              UHM (Unidad de Hinvestigación & Morbosidades Temporales) is a collective researching the concept of time and the creation of different devices to approach it differently in every iteration. UHM is an on-going process of coding, reflection and live collaborative work which purpose is to affect bodies. UHM members and research centres are not fixed and their work takes place in different parts of the American continent since 2017. Each project works with a different group of artists from different national constructs and indigenous cosmovisions, although the core group is integrated by artist, researcher, and curator <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rolandohernandez/p%C3%A1gina-principal">Rolando Hernández</a> (Oaxaca / Mexico City) and sound artist, time researcher, musician and programmer Alejandro Franco Briones (Mexico City // Hamilton, Ca).</div>
              <div style= "padding-top: 1%;">UHM’s first collaboration was an exploration of digital scoring devices presented at Santiago de Chile. A digital multi-modal score was performed unsuccessfully with the intention of producing a calendar. Second project was a broad collaboration with Nanc-In-A-Can, Ruido 13 and Umbral which took place in Mexico City (2019). A 90 minute long exploration of time concepts took the form of a live coded/improvised opera of a running person besieged by 13 time-keeping human/mechanic/digital computers.
              In 2020, they created <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/RadioAlhara/filmishmish_uhm/?fbclid=IwAR04w9ftaSlzR5gTiFQlx5nXb2JJnrGXG8Z2NbjxZva_qH-q24WdeExHGGY">Dos Sures</a> along with <a href="https://echoic.space">Diego Villaseñor</a>; this project was an algorithmic sound documentary which was part of FilMishMish, the 72 hour sonic protest hosted by <a href="https://yamakan.place/palestine/">Radio Alhara</a> against the annexation of a part of the West Bank.</div>

              UHM’s archive is composed by concepts, images, quotes, sounds, movies, scores, and experiences that deal with the notion of time. For this iteration of the archive we are proposing that the most relevant lens to focus time and space are Nahuatl culture traditional knowledges. The notion of archive is not the one of a fixed space with records inside, but a complex entanglement of philosophies that penetrate our bodies first, and maybe afterwise, produce archiving thoughts and impulses. In this way, we believe our archive should only live through the memory of others. Through listening, observing and present-tense decision making we will speculate about timelines and historiographies creating a narrative that is unfamiliar to a “common-sense” expectation hoping to seed in the imagination of the audience the UHM archive.

                The UHM research team created a documentary on-the-fly in which image, sound and text was live coded actualizing a long research on time and an audiovisual archive-in-process. UHM’s archive is composed by concepts, images, quotes, sounds, movies, scores, and experiences that deal with the notion of time. For this iteration of the archive we are proposing that the most relevant framework to understand time and space are Nahuatl culture traditional knowledges.

                This live documentary uses Estuary and one of its languages, CineCer0, as its main infrastructure; moreover, the proposed documentary will depend on the aforementioned archive which (formally) is a collection of heterogeneous resources scattered around the internet’s ecology. With this configuration (Estuary and CineCer0) we are capable of instantiating the archive as a documentary. Subtitles in a video, which are often relegated to a secondary role, come to the fore in the present documentary. Subtitles often do inhabit the space between the reality represented in the screen and the reality of the audience. In this project, the text displayed as subtitles interacts in a very particular way with the images and audio. Taking into consideration these tensions the present proposal will provide a lens with which we can focus in the infrareal: the liminal territory between the visible and the invisible in which precarity and danger engender life.

              <div style= "padding-top: 1%;">They premiered <b>In Xiuh Ce Amatl</b>, an experimental live coded documentary on the nahuatl concept of time for the <a href="https://networkmusicfestival.org/">Network Music Festival</a> and for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqoJ5FvQO2szofEEmU4iZg">Campamento Extendido Cyberpunk Post-Ternura</a> summer sessions in the year 2020. The documentary format inherently produces specific ways of seeing that are often confronted with otherness. In the documentary proposed, ambiguous conceptions of time neglected by modernity are not the object of observation but the point of view that reflects and confronts Western conceptions of time. In this project, time is an excuse to talk about history, Nahuatl philosophies, music and their entanglements. We are hoping that through careful observation the documentary will allow us to speculate about other timelines where we watch documentaries as a side effect of reading subtitles. </div>

        <div style= "padding-top: 1%;">
            Temazcal 2 is a documentary made with code through Estuary software. The documentary is structured in counterpoint. The first voice is a critical view of the work Temazcal (1984) for maracas and electronics, one of the most influential works of electroacoustic music in Mexico. Temazcal 2 references this historically work, particularly the ceremonial elements captured by the electroacoustic sonic imagination as an attempt to problematize its perception in the Anglo-experimental academic music spheres.

        <div style= "padding-top: 1%;">
            The second voice addresses the story of the family of one of the members of UHM and how his grandmother gave birth to several of her children in a temazcal. This research allows UHM to talk about migration, situated knowledge, mnemonic tradition and family restructuring with the help of interviews with the aunts and uncles of said member.

        <div style= "padding-top: 1%;">
            One of the singularities of the work with Estuary is the need to use interpreters to make the documentary. Having the members of UHM trained as composers, it is interesting to note how music rationale is still used to obtain results outside what is musical. This project reveals how composition has gradually emancipated itself from the musical field and it is becoming an autonomous field of creation, perhaps as an opportunity to reconfigure some aspects of the western-academic musical practice. The lines of code work as subtitles/scores that direct the creation of the audio as well as the movement of the text, photos and images, making this documentary exercise possible to have small changes each time it is performed.

            Temazcal 2 was created as part of the <i>&Now</i> residency program of the Factory Media Centre in Hamilton (Ontario) and it was premiered at the Network Imagination Laboratory at <s>McMaster University</s>. It has been performed in Mexico City and in Pátzcuaro (Michoacán, México) in the summer of 2022. It was part of the exhibition UTC (-) in the ArtSpeak gallery of the Art Council of Windsor and Region in November of 2022.

    This work is part of an exploration regarding migration, colonialism, gentrification, non-human movements, and the discourse, anti-discourse, and infra-discourse regarding land recognition. This work takes as its starting point an exchange of letters, often with no particular recipient.  Approaching the question of the land from different angles, this correspondence explores the transformation of our cities and spaces, the enclosures and displacements of our modern lives and the rising human cost of everything.

<div style= "padding-top: 1%;">
    This work is part of a broader exploration of tropes such as migration, colonialism, gentrification, non-human movements, and the discourse, anti-discourse, and infra-discourse regarding land recognition. This work takes as its starting point an exchange of letters, often with no particular recipient. Approaching the question of the land from different angles, this correspondence explores the transformation of our cities and spaces, the enclosures and displacements of our modern lives and the rising human cost of everything. In this way, Mexico City, Windsor, Hiba, Rolando, UHM, cars, gentrification, capitalism and solidarity exchange broken words in a tense and contemplative space. In the horizon of this exchange, an interplay of bright lights and sweeping shadows reveal new ways of seeing and understanding the city and our futures.
